h1. try-nodejs

"nodejs":http://nodejs.org/ is awesome. 

More people should try it.

Inspired by "try mongodb":http://try.mongodb.org/ . 

h2. How to use it

<pre>
$ node server.js
Server at http://127.0.0.1:8002/
</pre>

Open browser and visit "http://127.0.0.1:8002":http://127.0.0.1:8002

Very soon I will be putting it on web so that world could see how awesome nodejs is.
